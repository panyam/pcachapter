- [ ] **Cost analysis** - Real pricing comparisons
- [ ] **Architecture diagrams** - Visual documentation in images/

## Development Strategy

### Parallel Development Approach
1. **Code-driven chapter writing**: Implement examples first, then document
2. **Reader experience validation**: Test all setup instructions as we write
3. **Incremental validation**: Test each cloud deployment as we build
4. **Cost consciousness**: Track and optimize resource usage throughout

### Quality Gates
- **Local testing passes**: All PCA functionality works locally before cloud deployment  
- **Cross-cloud consistency**: Identical results across AWS/GCP/Azure
- **Performance targets**: <5 second response time, <$0.10 per demo execution
- **Reader experience**: 30-minute setup from zero to working demo

## Milestone Definitions

### Hello World SensorScope Complete ‚úÖ ‚Üí ‚è≥ (Target: Next 1-2 days)
- ‚úÖ Working local Flask application with comprehensive features
- ‚úÖ Chapter introduction and Hello World section written with Maya's narrative
- ‚úÖ Business cost analysis completed ($164K-$176K estimated savings)
- ‚è≥ Local testing validation completed
- [ ] Deployed and tested on all 3 clouds  
- [ ] Cross-platform validation confirms identical results

### Three Progressive Examples üìã (Target: Following week)  
- [ ] Example 1: IoT sensor pipeline (event-driven)
- [ ] Example 2: NYC taxi large dataset (workflow orchestration)
- [ ] Example 3: Stock market API (real-time processing)
- [ ] Chapter sections 2-4 completed

### Chapter Completion üìù (Target: Week 3)

## Success Metrics & Validation

### Technical Validation
- **Deployment success**: One-command deployment to each cloud
- **Result consistency**: Identical PCA outputs across all platforms  
- **Performance**: Response times under target thresholds
- **Cost efficiency**: Stay within estimated cost ranges

### Educational Validation  
- **Setup time**: <30 minutes from chapter to working demo
- **Clear instructions**: No ambiguous or missing steps
- **Practical value**: Real-world applicable patterns
- **Beginner friendly**: No advanced cloud expertise required

## Risk Mitigation

### Current Risks
- **Cloud API complexity**: Mitigate with thorough testing and documentation
- **Cost overruns**: Implement resource limits and monitoring from start
- **Reader experience**: Validate all instructions on fresh environments
- **Technical debt**: Maintain clean, well-documented code throughout

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Incremental validation**: Test each component as we build
- **Local-first approach**: Ensure everything works locally before cloud deployment
- **Multiple reviewers**: Get feedback on instructions and code quality
- **Cost monitoring**: Track expenses and optimize continuously

## Communication & Feedback

### Internal Checkpoints
- **Daily progress updates**: Track completion against TODO list
- **Weekly milestone reviews**: Assess progress against roadmap
- **Quality reviews**: Code and documentation quality checks
- **Reader experience testing**: Validate setup instructions regularly

This next steps plan provides clear prioritization and measurable milestones for completing the serverless PCA chapter while maintaining focus on reader experience and educational value.
